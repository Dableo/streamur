app path structure:
	- index.html
	- stream.js
	- stream/
		- main.js
		- view/
			- forms
			- display markup
	- lib/
		- require
		- documentReady
		- eventEmitter

we need:
	stream.js
		no game logic, only instantiation
		makes a game wherever there is a game class and passes it its parent node

	Main.js
		load modules
		each module requires the components that it needs
		if modules need to reference other instantiated modules, pass as function arg when its instantiated

	Input
		listens for keyboard, emits it with standard name
		currently only need tap

	Settings
		needs form component that generates its controls
		listens to them and emits changed event
		stores them as values
		some settings might not have a form representation
		ex: hitwindow timings

	NodeManager:
		listens for input
		creates new nodes
		gives them a deltaTime (remembers the last node for this)
		runs them through a bunch of processing modules, ending with putting them in the graph

	Nodes:
		deltaTime (since last node)
		maybe that's all?
		might want unstable rate (delta - avgDelta)

	NodeGraph:
		holds nodes
		has methods to perform operations on the graph

	averager:
		tracks avgDelta of all nodes and avgDelta of last n nodes
		gets graph to trim history if the avgDelta of recent nodes is different than the whole history, thus starting fresh
		gets unstable rate: node.delta - avgDelta (the ideal delta)

	Statistics
		tracks information used for display
		avg bpm (derived from avgDelta)
		avg unstable rate
